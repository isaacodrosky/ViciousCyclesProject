        <p class="bio">
          Vicious Cycles, Inc. is a Raleigh-based cycle workshop founded by a few
          like-minded individuals in late 2010. We hope to create and foster a strong passion
          for the local biking scene because each and every one of us is a
          biking enthusiast. We believe that every machine should be an
          extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of
          individualism and freedom.
        </p>
        
        <aside class="about-aside"><p>
          We build custom electric bicycles primarily for commuters, because we know there are no greater freedoms than no traffic jams, no road rage, no searching for parking, and no gas!

          <h2>The Founder</h2>
          <p>
            “I've spent my whole life on pedals. While I started off with
            engineering projects for companies in the bike industry, I also
            began to make notes and write down ideas for the bike I would make
            myself. I soon felt that my excitement wasn't going to get any less
            and decided to explore the road of what has now become Vicious!”

          <h2>The Mechanic</h2>
          <p>
            Jane began working on bicycles in college, when the chain broke on
            her bike. With no bike shops around and no method of transportation,
            she taught herself how to repair her bike and quickly learned how to
            fix any and all problems that could come up. She specializes in
            electric bike repair, but loves repairing all kinds of bikes!

          <h2>The Builder</h2>
          <p>
            Josh builds all of our custom cycles. His love for bikes began as a
            child, riding around town with his family and learning to fix any
            mechanical issues himself. As he grew up, he began modifying his
            cycles to fit his needs and building his own bicycle. For three
            years he's spreading his love of custom cycles to our customers!
